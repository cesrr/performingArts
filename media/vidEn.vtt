hello

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.899
for this video I will be reading the

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.900
architecture Wikipedia page to provide

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.580
some basic information on architecture

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.280

Designing and building as distinguished

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.500
from the skills associated with

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.539
construction

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.180
it is both the process and the product

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.880
of sketching conceiving planning

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.800
designing and constructing buildings or

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.059
other structures

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.320

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.399
of buildings are often perceived as

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.620
cultural symbols and as works of art

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.480
